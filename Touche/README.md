## Touche

Touche is a FinTech company with the aim of improve
user experience in the Hospitality field, 
improving payment experience for the user, offering also discounts, 
and integrating external services, for a unique Payment Platform.

What I've done there:

- Helped on the migration of the monolith legacy API to Java microservices using RXJava, Maven and
Apache Kafka. 
- Achieved a very difficult and important integration (PoC) in 5 months, between the Touchè backend
payment and Oracle® Hospitality 
- Carried on autonomously the resolutions of all the issues, as the technology of Oracle was old (IIS Server and SOAP
Protocol), and left a well-documented code and practices.

**Tech stack**

- Java Spring microservices (RXJava) 
- CI Pipeline with Kubernetes
- Kafka
- Docker
- RabbitMQ
- SCRUM, weekly Sprints.
