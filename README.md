### Backend and Python Developer

<!--
**RobertaBtt/RobertaBtt** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

GitHub is a place where I've put some code that I've wrote in the past jobs, and some other
projects that I've finished for recruitment projects and others just to keep doing exercises on the code.

Now I am focused on Python,
more simple and light than other languages.
