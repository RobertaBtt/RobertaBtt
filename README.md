### Backend and Python Developer


GitHub is a place where I've put some code that I've wrote in the past jobs, and some other
projects that I've finished for recruitment projects and others just to keep doing exercises on the code.

Now I am focused on Python,
more simple and light than other languages.

- Iâ€™m currently working on some integrations with Amazon Web Services
- Iâ€™m currently learning some Data Science principles with the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate
- These are my Badges from this Coursera Coure: https://www.youracclaim.com/users/roberta-btt
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with companies that work with Renewable Energies, or that are involve in Circular Economy or that are involved
in general on Sustainable Food and that are cutting the fast fashion.
These are the topics I am interested to work with.
All the other business, keep it for you.
